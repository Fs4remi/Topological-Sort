## An implementation of topological sort 
Taking advantage of being a current student and have a readily available list of classes plus their prerequisites for the Computer Science B.S. degree from my school, to create a graph out of my classes and perform a topological sort on it 
### steps
- construct the graph by organizing the courses and the prerequisites 
- create the matrix representing the graph
- perform dfs recursively
- keep track of the order of pop from stack memory
